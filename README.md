**Thank you for viewing my project!** Zodiac is a spiritual successor to the Tapwave Zodiac and other portables, and is 100% open source.

Zodiac is my attempt at a device that's timeless, being as useful today as it is in 10 years. Zodiac is not intended to be your primary portable and for this reason, it does not concern itself with top performance. Zodiac is based around the humble RP2040.

Why this device in this year? Zodiac sits alongside the Playdate as a new and fun platform for developers. However in the spirit of the original Tapwave Zodiac, it aims to take on an additional role; be a utility as much as a games console. To that end, the Zodiac is good for 7 days of heavy use, one month of typical use, or 2 years while sleeping. Also it will have enough storage to back up Wikipedia. If there is an apocolypse, this is the device you want in your backpack- not a phone, computer, or tablet.
